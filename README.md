# PokeDokuClone
A clone of [PokeDoku](https://pokedoku.com/) where users try to fill in a 3x3 grid of Pokemon. Made in Python using PySimpleGUI.

Pokemon data sources from [Pokemon Showdown's](https://github.com/smogon/pokemon-showdown/blob/master/data/pokedex.ts) GitHub repository. Please disregard the parsing in `util.py`, it was strange parsing from a `.ts` file like that. It was much easier to work with as a `.json` file.
